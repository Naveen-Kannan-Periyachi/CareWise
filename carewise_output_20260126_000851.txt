Title:
Immune cell-based therapies for solid tumors, current challenges and therapeutic advances.

Content:
Solid tumors remain difficult to treat due to antigen heterogeneity, physical barriers that limit immune-cell trafficking, and a profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Over the past decade, cancer immunotherapy advanced considerably through innovative strategies, including macrophage reprogramming and CAR-macrophages, dendritic-cell (DC) vaccines, natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cell approaches, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy, TCR-engineered and CAR-T cells, emerging B-cell engineering, and cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Here we summarize how each modality interacts with the TME, highlight key clinical milestones (e.g., FDA approval of a TIL product for melanoma in 2024), and outline bioengineering strategies-multi-antigen targeting, cytokine armoring, trafficking cues, and safety switches-that aim to overcome resistance and toxicity. We also review EV-based, cell-free strategies that retain tumor specificity with potentially improved safety and manufacturability. Finally, we discuss remaining barriers-standardized manufacturing, on-target/off-tumor effects, limited persistence-and propose rational combinations with checkpoint blockade, radiotherapy, and targeted agents. This overview positions immune cell-based therapy as a rapidly maturing, transformative approach for solid tumors.

Title:
Immunotherapy-mediated cancer reversion: Possibilities and prospects.

Content:
Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment by enabling durable tumor control through immune activation. Emerging evidence suggests that beyond cytotoxic elimination, immune responses can reprogram malignant cells toward normalized, differentiated states, a phenomenon termed immunotherapy-mediated cancer reversion. This paradigm shift positions the immune system as a restorative rather than solely destructive force. This review synthesizes contemporary evidence on immunotherapy-mediated cancer reversion, evaluating mechanistic pathways and clinical implications across diverse malignancies to establish a conceptual framework for immune-driven phenotypic normalization. A comprehensive narrative review was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, encompassing literature from 2015 to 2025. Evidence was synthesized thematically across immune checkpoint blockade, adoptive cell therapies, cytokine modulation, and microenvironmental remodeling. Immune-mediated reversion arises through coordinated epigenetic, metabolic, and microenvironmental reprogramming. Checkpoint inhibitors restore differentiation programs via IFNγ-driven chromatin remodeling, while CAR-T and NK-cell therapies induce metabolic normalization and epithelial restoration. Cytokine signaling and macrophage reprogramming reinforce reversion by modulating angiogenesis and stromal architecture. Clinical observations across melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, hematologic malignancies, and hepatocellular carcinoma support this restorative immune process. Single-cell and spatial omics identify transitional states bridging malignancy and normalcy. Immunotherapy-mediated cancer reversion represents a conceptual frontier shifting oncology from eradication to restoration. Future progress requires defining biomarkers, confirming mechanistic permanence, and redesigning clinical endpoints. As integrative immuno-epigenetic frameworks mature, immune-driven reversion may evolve from biological curiosity to clinically reproducible pathway toward durable remission and functional cure.

Title:
Immunotheranostics in Solid Tumors: Longitudinal Tracking of Human IL13Rα2 CAR-T Cells In Vivo.

Content:
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown limited success in the treatment of solid tumors, reinforcing the need to elucidate the in vivo biodistribution of these engineered T cells. Here, we integrate the anti-DOTA huC825 reporter ("Thor") platform into newly developed human anti-interleukin-13 receptor α-2 (IL13Rα2)-single-cell fragment variable (scFv)-derived CAR-T cells and investigate its utility for mapping CAR-T cell distribution in a xenograft mouse model of melanoma.
